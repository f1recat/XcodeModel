# Modata

Legacy now. This gem was used to generate iOS and Android source code from RoR models.
Also it enabled webservices to provide the data to mobile applications and 3d party websites.

However, now I am using node.js and react for V and rails-api for M and C, which means that I no longer need this gem...
